## Notes: A Note-Taking App with Core React Concepts

This is a web-based note-taking application built with React that demonstrates the power of state variables (`useState`), the `useEffect` hook, and conditional rendering. It provides a user-friendly platform to capture and organize your ideas effortlessly.

### Mastering React Fundamentals

This app serves as a playground to explore how essential React features contribute to building dynamic and interactive experiences:

* State Variables (useState): `useState` is used to manage the ever-changing state of the application, including the list of notes and the currently edited note.
* useEffect Hook: This hook is leveraged to retrieve saved notes from local storage (if available) and store updated notes upon changes.
* Conditional Rendering: We utilize conditional rendering to display various parts of the UI based on user actions, such as showing the edit form only for the selected note.

### Keeping Your Thoughts Organized

This app offers an intuitive way to manage your notes:

* Create New Notes: Effortlessly add new notes with a single click.
* Edit Notes: Easily modify existing notes by selecting them from the list.
* Save and Delete: Save your notes to local storage for persistence and delete them when no longer needed.
* Search Functionality: Quickly find specific notes using the search bar (implemented in a future iteration).

Note: This initial version focuses on core React concepts and basic note management. Future enhancements can include search functionality and more advanced formatting options.

### Technologies Used

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Framework: Vite React (vitejs.dev [invalid URL removed])

### Setting Up Your Note-Taking Journey

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/keepitsimple-notes.git
```

2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the App:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:5173/.

### Understanding the Codebase

Explore the code to see how these React concepts are implemented:

* Note component: Manages note content and state variables for editing.
* New note button: Triggers state updates to add new notes.
* Edit functionality: Renders an edit form based on the selected note and updates the state when changes are saved.
* Note list:** Conditionally renders the list of notes and handles note selection.

Note: This is a simplified project for educational purposes. Future functionalities can explore localStorage integration and search implementation.
